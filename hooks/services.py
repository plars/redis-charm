"""Redis charm service definitions and management.

This charm uses the service framework to handle all of its hooks except for the
install hook. See https://pythonhosted.org/charmhelpers/examples/services.html

Two service definitions are provided to the manager: redis-master and
redis-slave. The idea is that either the former or the latter can be ready at
the same time, but not both or none. If the "redis1:master redis2:slave"
relation is established and ready, then the redis-slave service definition is
enabled on redis2 units. In all the other cases the redis-master definition is
enabled.

The redis server itself is always running, and it is only restarted when a
change is detected in its configuration file, due to charm config changes or to
slave relation established.
